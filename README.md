As featured in Treehugger, Mother Nature Network, and Organic Authority, our app helps you find local restaurants offering humanely-raised, vegan, and vegetarian options.

Eating out as an ethical consumer can often be difficult. Using our restaurant finder makes it easy to find nearby vegan, vegetarian and veg-friendly places, and restaurants which source their food from farms that treat animals humanely.

The app contains more than 20,000 restaurant names throughout the US, complete with directions and reviews to help you easily locate nearby eateries serving ethical products.

Whether you’re vegan, vegetarian, or looking for restaurants offering high welfare food, the Humane Eating Project app is a powerful tool for you to use in the fight against factory farming. The app even features a ‘watch list’ of the restaurants serving particularly cruel animal products like foie gras and veal, so you know which places to avoid when looking for somewhere to eat out.

Searching our restaurant locator to find humane dining options near you, is a simple but effective way of using technology to fight animal cruelty. As a caring consumer, our app gives you the ability to use your purchasing power to create change. 

The Humane Eating Project app has been created by America for Animals, a non-profit charity dedicated to fighting cruelty and improving animal welfare.
